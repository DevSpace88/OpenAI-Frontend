# OpenAI-Frontend

A front-end for OpenAI's Rest-API, you can ask coding questions, but also other stuff. The focus in this project was to practice building an own front-end that accesses the services of OpenAI.

Front-end is made with VanillaJS and Vite and backend with node and express to build a server that accesses the openai-restapi. Frontend is deployed on Vercel while backend is deployed on Render.
